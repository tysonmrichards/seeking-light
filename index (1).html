                insight: "I've learned that faith isn't about eliminating all doubt—it's about planting the seed and watching it grow in darkness. Like Alma teaches, sometimes growth happens beneath the surface where we can't see it. My faith has grown most when I've been willing to experiment on God's words, living as if they were true even when I wasn't completely sure. The 'swelling motions' Alma describes are real—I've felt my soul enlarge, my understanding enlighten, and truth become delicious to me. Faith is choosing to act in the space between hope and certainty."

                insight: "One of the most liberating truths I've discovered in this class is that 'inspired questions should be considered gifts from God.' Questions aren't signs of weakness—they're invitations to deeper understanding. Alma doesn't condemn the Zoramites for struggling to believe; instead, he meets them where they are and says 'even if ye can no more than desire to believe.' My journey has taught me that God honors honest questions. The process of seeking answers has strengthened my faith more than if I had been given easy answers from the beginning."

When I'm struggling with anxiety, disappointment, or feeling inadequate, I remember that He suffered these things too 'that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people.' The promise that 'my grace is sufficient' and that weak things can become strong has given me hope.

God gives us weakness intentionally so we'll turn to Him. My biggest doubts have ultimately led me to deeper faith as I've worked through them with God's help."
